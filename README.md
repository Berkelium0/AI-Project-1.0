# Repository for ss24.1.0.a/ry68fesa-1
This is the repository for you solution. You can modify this README file any way you see fit.

**Topic:** SS24 Assignment 1.0.A (Warm-up): Clean the Wumpus Cave

**Early deadline:** 2024-05-02 *(make an early submission until this date that would get you at least 1 point for the solution (not the README/explanation). Otherwise we might think that you are not interested in the project and give your spot to someone of the waiting list.)*

**If you don't know git:** You might be interested in [this note](https://gitlab.rrze.fau.de/wrv/AISysProj/admin/general/-/blob/main/git-intro.md?ref_type=heads), which introduces git and links to a video with a hands-on introduction specific for AISysProj.


Assignment 1.0.A
================

This repository contains the data for assignment 1.0.A.
You should create solution files for the problems in the `problems/` directory.
The repository also contains `example-problems` along with `example-solutions` that you can use for testing your implementation.

#### `verify.py`
You can use `verify.py` to check your solutions for the example problems.
It will send them to a server and print out some feedback.
It requires the `requests` package (`python3 -m pip install requests`).
Then you can run the script with:
```
python3 verify.py path/to/your/example/solutions
```
